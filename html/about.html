Chinese cuisine is an important part of Chinese culture and includes cuisines originating from China. <br>
Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in Asia and beyond,<br>
 with modifications made to cater to local palates. Chinese food staples such as rice, <br>
soy sauce, noodles, tea, chili oil, and tofu, and utensils such as chopsticks and the wok, can now be found worldwide.<br>
The preferences for seasoning and cooking techniques of Chinese provinces depend on differences in historical background and ethnic groups.<br>
Geographic features including mountains, rivers, forests, and deserts also have a strong effect on the local available ingredients,<br>
considering that the climate of China varies from tropical in the south to subarctic in the northeast. <br>
Imperial royal and noble preference also plays a role in the change of Chinese cuisine.<br>
Because of imperial expansion and trading, ingredients and cooking techniques from other cultures have been integrated into Chinese cuisines over time.<br>
There are numerous regional, religious, and ethnic styles of Chinese cuisine found within China and abroad.<br>
The most praised Four Great Traditions in Chinese cuisine are Chuan, Lu, Yue, and Huaiyang,<br>
representing cuisines of West, North, South, and East China, respectively.<br>
The modern Eight Cuisines of China are Anhui (徽菜; Huīcài), Guangdong (粤菜; Yuècài), Fujian (闽菜; Mǐncài),<br>
 Hunan (湘菜; Xiāngcài), Jiangsu (苏菜; Sūcài), Shandong (鲁菜; Lǔcài), Sichuan (川菜; Chuāncài), and Zhejiang (浙菜; Zhècài) cuisines.<br>
